This a classicatrion task whereby CNN (Convolutional Neural Netowrk) is applied on land cover images.

The data can be access here: https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/30871912

The nework build is shallow and the mail purpose this repository is to showcase how the classification 
can be done with CNN. It coves the whole process from building a custom dataloader, building CNN architecture,
Model training and Evaluation.

There is also exercise provided in the notebook to help further understanding.
